- [ ] User should see a top app bar that shows his info like name, avatar, etc...
- [ ] User should see a list of Apps that you'll get via this endpoint `https://pushbots-fend-challenge.herokuapp.com/api/apps` but you'll need pagination params set before it works.
- [ ] User should be able to paginate this list via the provided endpoint.
- [ ] Each app card should have a chart that shows engagement data for that app.
- [ ] You can find the chart data in the App object.
- [ ] Each app should have some action buttons like the screen below but just make them dummy, only ui, not real actions.
- [ ] Generally the dashboard design should look some what like the screen below.
- Use email: `frontend@ninja.com` and password: `12345` for the login request.

### Nice to have

- Great attention to accessibility and its rules following WCAG 2.1
- Unit testing with Jest (Kudos if you integrate it in your pipeline with Netlify).
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) integration for your project and add its badge to the README.
- Code quality checks like [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) and add its badge to the README.

### What we're looking for

- **Simple, clear, readable code** - How well structured it is? Clear separation of concerns? Can anyone just look at it and get the idea to what is being done? Does it follow any standards?
- **Correctness** - Does the application do what it promises? Can we find bugs or trivial flaws?
- **No errors in the console screen** 

### Questions & submissions

- If you have any questions regarding this challenge, please reach out to us and we'll get back to you ASAP.
- Please submit your code as a link to a public GitHub repository.
- If you didn't meet all requirements listed above, don't worry about it and just submit what you have done so far.
